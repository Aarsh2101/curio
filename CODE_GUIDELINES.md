## Project structure

Keep files where they belong.

- **`backend/`**: Manages database access and user authentication.
- **`images/`**: Images for documentation.
- **`sandbox/`**: Sandbox foe executing python code inside Curio.
- **`urban-workflows/`**: Manages database access and user authentication.
    - **`src/`**: Curio's source code.
        - **`components/`**: React components and respective CSS. Create a different file for each component. Keep similar components groupped inside folders.
- **`utk-workflow/`**: Stores a version of [UTK](https://github.com/urban-toolkit/utk) that can be embedded.
- **`TODO.md`**: Temporary (eventually all TODOs will be added as issues to the project). 

## Naming conventions

## Contribution guidelines and standards

Before sending your pull request for [review](https://github.com/urban-toolkit/curio/pulls), make sure your changes are consistent with the guidelines.

### General guidelines and philosophy for contribution

- Include unit tests when you contribute new features, as they help to a) prove that your code works correctly, and b) guard against future breaking changes to lower the maintenance cost.
- Bug fixes also generally require unit tests, because the presence of bugs usually indicates insufficient test coverage.
- Unit testing: Aim for >90% incremental test coverage for all your code (check [writing tests](#writing-tests)).
- Only add new dependencies if strictly necessary.

### React and JSX coding style

Changes to Curio React and JSX code should conform to [Airbnb React/JSX Style Guide](https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/). 

The [Javascript coding style](#javascript-coding-style) takes precedence in case of conflicts.

### Javascript coding style

Changes to Curio Javascript code should conform to [Google JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html).

### Python coding style

Changes to Curio Python code should conform to [Google Python Style Guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md).

Use pylint to check your Python changes. To install pylint and check a file with pylint:

```bash
pip install pylint
pylint myfile.py
```

## Writing code

Contribute to code in a self-contained manner to keep the code modularized. As a rule of thumb Curio should be able to keep working if your code is removed.  

Every contribution implements **one** new feature or fix **one** bug. Very similar features and bugs can be groupped into one contribution.  

One contribution = One pull request.  

### New feature

Create new components for new features. 

Modify a component if expanding a feature.

Components must be as independent of each other as possible. If one component depend on another create a reusable API or simple communication interface.
